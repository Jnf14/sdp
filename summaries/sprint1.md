# Summary for week 1
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar
- Done: I created a project on the firebase website and started learning how and where firebase can be used.
- Went well: I learned a lot of details about firebase (considering that I didn't know what firebase was a week ago), and estimating larger amounts of time for simpler tasks seems to be a good decision to compensate for the unfamiliarity with firebase.
- To improve: Next time, I will know which documentations to read for specific problems I run into.

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina (Scrum Master)
- Done: I implemented a profile page and played a bit with design. I got familiar with sketch and UI kits and their imports to XML.
- Went well: I feel comfortable with UI design.
- To improve: Next time I should do some code logic.

## Linder, Jan David
- Done: I was able to implement the map that is now displayed. I struggled with establishing a secret for the API key, which took me a lot of time and still doesn't work properly in a local repo.
- Went well: I also struggled with testing as the only implemented functionality is displaying the map. In the end, my time estimate was okay.
- To improve: Next time, I hope to be more efficient in using the coding environment and Kotlin such that I can progress faster.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
- Done: I finished all of the game logic and set up the GameActivity that will hold the game. I still have to retrieve user input and pass it to the game logic in order to make the game functional.
- Went well: My time estimate was much longer than expected, since designing the game logic was more complicated than expected and design choices for code prettiness took up lots of time (I also maybe wrote too much code).
- To improve: Next time I will realistically estimate my time spent, and maybe do some prototyping before actually writing the code so I don't have to refactor all the time.

## Roust, Michael Murad
- Done: I finished a google sign-in (not through firebase which will thus be scrapped).
- Went well: Not much. It took a very long time to fix several problems I had such as not storing secret keys in public.
- To improve: My time estimation was way to optimisitic and I was unable to write tests in time. Next time I will work more
incrementally and hopefully not have the same problems as this week.

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
- Done: I implemented an abstract gyro activity so that other activities can detect flips along the x-axis.
- Went well: My time estimate was a bit below of what I actually did, even though I did not write many LOC I struggled with the basics of Kotlin and Android Studio
- To improve: Next time, I should hopefully not run into this as I learnt a lot from this week.

## Overall team
- Done: We have a rich game logic, fully implemented. We can display the map and have an abstract gyro activity that detects flips. We played a bit with design.
- Went well: Everyone managed to setup the app., got familiar with PRs, managed to accomplish tasks. We had 2 standup meetings during the week, well distributed.
- To improve: Realistically estimate time. Pick smaller tasks.
