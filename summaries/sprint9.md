# Summary for week 8
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar


## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina


## Linder, Jan David
Done: I implemented the profile picture such that it is stored on the CloudStorage and linked to a user. As I had some more times, I tried to work on better tests for services like the database and CloudStorage, but unfortunately I lost a lot of time because mockito is really not easy to use in instrumented android tests. Therefore, it was impossible to mock Tasks, hence I needed to convert those to futures.
Went well: I managed to finish last weeks task quite quickly.
To improved: I missed a stand-up meeting - this should not happen!
## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
Done this week: finally finished Bluetooth gameplay
Went well: extremely efficient pair programming with Erik, we know the Bluetooth code well now
To improve: more tests

## Roust, Michael Murad


## Wengle, Erik Alessandro (Scrum Master)
Done: I refactored the entire code of the Bluetooth Activity and its respective classes
Went well: I was able to finish work quickly using Android studio's tools and was able to progress to write tests
To improve: In the future, I should write clean code from the beginning in order to spend less work in refactoring

## Overall team (Scrum Master: Erik)
- Done: We were finally able to have a working bluetooth game
- Went well: Communication between now goes very smoothly and efficient
- To improve: Once again, most of the work is done on thursday night / friday morning, which we should change.
