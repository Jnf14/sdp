# Summary for week 11
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar
- Done: Found some bugs and/or minor design flaws.
- Went well: The bugs I found aren't extremely big and should be easy to fix.
- To improve: Didn't feel well (allergies) so I couldn't finish my work, will make up for it next week.

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina

- Went well: Managed to merge my task this week.
- To improve: discuss requirements with TAs before starting to implement a task.

## Linder, Jan David
- Done: Continued on the OGS service (that then was almost finished by Kimon). Improved the searching for players on the map
- Went well: Context switching went very well this week. I worked on OGS, helped out Michael with the profile and worked on the map.
- To improve: We need to focus on the testing and get that done. As I have a lot of experience of testing this semester, I have to take some responsibility for this.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios

## Roust, Michael Murad (Scrum Master)
- Done: A lot of things
  - Fixed major bugs with Chat together with Szabina. When you try to open a new chat conversation it shows your friends instead of all users now.
  - Fixed a minor bug that when you login to the app you aren't shown the profile page but just a blank screen.
  - Jan helped me move the profile picture editing from the ProfileActivity to ProfileEditActivity.
  - Implemented logic and UI for searching for users by nickname and being able to send and accept friend requests.
- Went well: Despite drowning in work in literally every other project I still found time for work 3x overtime on SDP. I was determined
to bring the social system of our application to a functional and useful level. Happy with my coding.
- To improve: Testing. Next week will be all for that.

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
- Done: Usernames are now displayed when looking for bluetooth opponents
- Went well: I merged something! And early too!
- To improve: My code is fairly undocumented and untested due to me not having enough time

## Overall team (Scrum Master)
- Done: Everyone advancing steadily on work. We have good efficient meetings and work well together. Each member of the team has their areas of
expertise and when needed we help each other out!
- Went well: Good coordination, hard work! Everything as it should be.
- To improve: A few issues with CI we should figure it out very soon. More TESTS (Our team will handle it, we're confident about that)!
