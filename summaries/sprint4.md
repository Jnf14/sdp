# Summary for sprint 4
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar (Scrum Master)
- Done: Configured realtime database (Firestore can't detect offline usage without paying so I couldn't use it) and set up a schema for data storage
- Went well: Database is ready for testing and should be simple to use (for now)
- To improve: Find a way to mock the database for cirrus and improve the schema for future use cases

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina
- Done: I have been continuing the implementation of the chat activity. Added an interface for Firebase. It requires to discuss the data storage in Firestore to get tested. I have started to read about Android UIs in general to standardize the activities.
- Went well: Time expectation went well.
- To improve: Kotlin coding experience.

## Linder, Jan David
- Done: I learned the rules of Go myself and added a very basic tutorial to our app. Another great achievement are tests for the new activity and the main activity that can work locally and on cirrus - we can use those as examples for other activities.
- Went well: I finally feel pretty comfortable in writing tests.
- To improve: First of all, the tutorial is not finished at all, we need to invest more time into that. And the quality of some tests can still be improved.
