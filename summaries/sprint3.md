# Summary for sprint 3
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar
- Done: Familiarization with Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore
- Went well: Learned a lot about the database options, their differences, and pros/cons
- To improve: Still not sure which option is better for the app, will try Cloud Firestore which will hopefully cover all bases

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina
- Done: I contributed a bit for the UI of the chat application as well as I reviewed how to communicate with the database (sending, receiving messages).
- Went well: We managed to finish the task, experienced team work.
- To improve: Next time I should look for text based tutorials as I got lost and confused with videos, spent lots of time with no efficiency.

## Linder, Jan David (Scrum Master)
- Done: Together with Szabina we implemented the front-end of the chat.
- Went well: We worked together efficiently, which left me some time to create a logo for our app and prepare the presentation. Furthermore, I did some refactoring of the code.
- To improve: I can still improve my testing skills, we will not reach 80% test coverage.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
- Done: Researched how to add C++ code to the project, added shared library to sources and added interfaces for katago
- Went well: Finally understand the C compilation process...
- To improve: Figure out how to cross-compile for other architectures....

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
- Done: Implemented basic bluetooth connectivity between two devices
- Went well:Learnt a lot about bluetooth communication in android apps
- To improve: Do more research before implementing it in order to save time

## Overall team (Scrum Master)
- Done: We now have a chat and an almost functioning connection to a backend. Furthermore, we explored new topic such as Bluetooth.
- Went well: Our work flow is great. We work independently, but call for help when needed. Our app takes shape - thanks to great work. Also the PR are out earlier, a goal that we reached from last week.
- To improve: It would be nice if everyone was on time for the stand-up meetings, it would make them even more efficient.
