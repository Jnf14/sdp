# Summary for week 0
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar (Scrum Master)
- Done: Matchmaking pairs up queueing players to play.
- Went well: Managed to finish debugging a lot of stuff.
- To improve: Still not pairing by elo rating, might implement some variant in the future depending on expected player base.

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina
- Done: I picked a high-priority task, the implementation of caching string values. I modified the UI of the profile activity. I created a last messages channel that lists the last conversation with chat partners.
- Went well: Managed to merge several tasks. I managed to fulfil each task for this week.
- To improve: Concentrate on one task type only. 8 hours per week is a tiny period.

## Linder, Jan David
- Done: We advanced quite well on the online Go service. We were able to merge it in the end, but it's not yet complete.
- Went well: Good team work with Kimon. We also wrote good code.
- To improve: WHY is a JSONObject not usable? This wasted more than two hours and quality of the code. Furthermore, we're now forced by the format of this class to work WAY too much to be able to finish somehow. So I guess time management is not good.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
- Done: First implementation of Online GO.
- Went well: Managed to write tests from the beginning because online part was well abstracted and could be mocked easily.
- To improve: Understand JSONObjects.

## Roust, Michael Murad
- Done: Database User System integration is nearly complete! Users can now edit their information and send it to be stored in the database!
- Went well: Even though it took longer then expected (as pretty much always) Work went quite smoothly as all required components/modules were well designed!
- To improve: I'm very happy with my work this week. Despite being overworked in several other projects including this one I managed to get everything done this week, unlike last week! If I'm nitpicky I would say starting to work earlier but I never had the possibility to do that.

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
- Done:
- Went well:
- To improve:

## Overall team (Scrum Master)
- Done: Held two short meetings, coordinated about current and future tasks.
- Went well: Team communication seems to have improved by a huge amount. We're focusing on the problems at hand and the delivery of a finished product by the end of the semester.
- To improve: Test coverage went down. A lot. Although this is a negative for this week on paper, we had already discussed it and decided to finish functionality ASAP, and then focus on testing.
