## Roust, Michael Murad
- Done: Changed User class from using Firestore to RealtimeDatabase. In the process I decoupled all online elements
such as Database and Authentication from the User class to allow for it to be tested with a Mock Database.
- Went well: Cleaning up the User class code and modifing exisiting code to fit the changes. Understanding RealtimeDatabase.
- To improve: After switiching to RealtimeDatabase I realise that this will unfortunatly make things more tedious to work
with lists. Also mocking the database will be a very challenging task since some functionalities we will probably use
are quite complex, but I guess we will hear more from the team about this.
