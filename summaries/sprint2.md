## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina
- Done:
- Went well:
- To improve:

## Linder, Jan David
Done: I successfully added a location layer to the map which is able to get the current location of a user.
Went well: My time planning was good and I had enough time to review and give feedback to other pull requests as well as finish my tasks.
To improve: I waste a lot of time with testing my implementation, the emulator is horribly slow on my PC. I need to find better ways to test what I have implemented.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
Done: Finished the game loop and linked touch input to the game loop to create a working demo.
Went well: Szabina wrote great code for the UI, so it was easy to integrate it into the game loop
To improve: better tests in the future

## Roust, Michael Murad (Scrum Master)
Done: I successfully setup part of the firebase authentication system which now works with email password. The next step will be sign-in with google account. Cleaned up some files.
Went well: Managed to get a good understanding of Firebase and how we will use it throughout our app.
To improve: Hopefully, will have more time to work on SDP in future weeks.

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
- Done: I added a pacedplayer class which allows to make the bot play as slow as a regular player, as well as a class that allows to convert our game logic into GTP commands in order to communicate with the bot
- To improve: Given that the bot and remote player will be implemented later, I should have either waited or planned the converter better, as it still will need more finetuning in the future

## Overall team (Scrum Master)
- Done: We've completed an actually playable game, a working map/location system and login system. Which can all be accessed from the main Activity.
- Went well: We've made excellent progress this week. We did well at splitting big into groups and working in our subgroups to
complete these tasks and had productive and effective scrum standups.
- To improve: Improve task time estimations and separation of user stories into more slightly more manageable tasks.
