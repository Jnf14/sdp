## Linder, Jan David
- Done: I implemented a profile picture (either taken with the camera or chosen from the gallery) that is stored locally.
- Went well: I learned a lot about data exchange with the phone, Intents and permissions. This knowledge will be very useful for future Android programming
- To improve: My time estimation was very bad. I didn't complete the whole task and even like that I worked > 10 hours. Next time I should be more careful with time estimation when entering into a new topic.

## Overall team (Scrum Master: Jan)
- Done: We advanced quite a lot on the user, made again great progress on the bluetooth. Our meetings were very efficient and productive.
- Went well: I feel like the team work is perfectly configured now, and collaboration always works smoothly. This is great.
- To improve: We often have troubles to have something to push. We should therefore either choose smaller tasks (and consider in advance that testing takes a lot of time) or work together on tasks of our 'usual' size.
