# Summary for week 8
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar
- Done: Set up connecting 2 players to an activity so they can play online
- Went well: Actually writing the code
- To improve: Fixing cirrus issues still takes more time than actually writing the code

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina
- Done: I created a navigation graph for our app.
- Went well: We have a visual overview on our workflow. It lets us focus more on priorities.
- To improve: Instead of a basic implementation I deep dived into the more advanced features and could not deliver in time.

## Linder, Jan David (Scrum Master)
- Done: I implemented a profile picture (either taken with the camera or chosen from the gallery) that is stored locally. Unfortunately I could not merge to main because the tests that work locally won't pass on Cirrus. We need to discuss that with the assistants.
- Went well: I learned a lot about data exchange with the phone, Intents and permissions. This knowledge will be very useful for future Android programming
- To improve: My time estimation was very bad. I didn't complete the whole task and even like that I worked > 10 hours. Next time I should be more careful with time estimation when entering into a new topic.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
- Done: nearly finished Bluetooth gameplay
- Went well: very efficient pair programming with Erik, managed to get a lot done!
- To improve: write more tests

## Roust, Michael Murad
- Done: Completed social/friend system. We can now send friend requests and accept them and list current friends and their profile info. Next step is to connect the logic to the UI.
- Went well: Great functional async code written
- To improve: We could better modularize some code here but I don't see a good enough reason to do that.

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
- Done: I made the bluetooth search asynchronous and restricted the search to Let's Go Users
- Went well: Together with kimon we got more than that, but it's not working yet
- To improve: It's been a long while that I have been unable to contribute to the main branch, due to my tasks being just too big, Next time I'll first write tests and then continue work

## Overall team (Scrum Master: Jan)
- Done: We advanced quite a lot on the user, made again great progress on the bluetooth. Our meetings were very efficient and productive.
- Went well: I feel like the team work is perfectly configured now, and collaboration always works smoothly. This is great.
- To improve: We often have troubles to have something to push. We should therefore either choose smaller tasks (and consider in advance that testing takes a lot of time) or work together on tasks of our 'usual' size.
