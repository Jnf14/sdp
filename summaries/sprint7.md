# Summary for week 7
---

## Bajraktarov, Dimitar
- Done: Implemented ELO formula for rating change. Implemented game pairing without any server-side code i.e. only with database transactions.
- Went well: Matchmaking algorithm seems to work well.
- To improve: Improve matchmaking to accurately match players according to their skill (since it's totally random right now).

## Horvath-Mikulas, Szabina (Scrum Master)
Done: I have implemented a general app bar and navigation bar for our app. The design is launched by the abstract BaseActivity that can be extended by any other activities.
Went well: this week I could finish my task in time.
To improve: my test framework has bugs, for a reason Android Studio does not start any of the tests.

## Linder, Jan David
Done: I completed the tutorial such that it teaches the basic rules. Some added features are an programmable opponent for the puzzles and a reset button.
Went well: Perfect time planning and very high test coverage on the new code.
To improve: I guess I should now go back into some more challenging coding as the end of the project is getting closer and closer.

## Protopapas, Kimon Dimitrios
Done this week: Finalized Bluetooth player architecture and Refactored general Bluetooth server/service functionality
Went well: really improved architecture of both Bluetooth game and Bluetooth server
To improve: add more tests

## Roust, Michael Murad
Done this week: Started implementing friend list
Went well: Spend some time cleaning up User class.
To improve: Wasn't able to get nearly as much work as intended due to other projects. Will catchup on the weekend!

## Wengle, Erik Alessandro
Done this week: limited bluetooth device finding to active lets go app
Went well: The bluetooth architecture is shaping up nicely and I learnt a lot about it
To improve: while adding this feature i broke the part that enables bluetooth communication, which i now need to fix

## Overall team (Scrum Master)
- Done: We managed to improve most of our activities, close to completion. We have a design layout, a nice tutorial, bluetooth is soon on horizon and matching algorithm is improved. The users are also displayed as friends.
- Went well: Nice collaboration, smooth and efficient working environment, fruitful standups.
- To improve: We should start to focus on priorities and to put the app in one.
